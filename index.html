          Welcome! This is where I'll keep track of my progress as I build
          <strong>Rolyn</strong> over the next few months. I'll post updates,
          thoughts, and milestones here as I go.

        <h3 class="post-title">Started the Rolyn Blog!</h3>
        <p>
          Today I set up this blog to document my journey building Rolyn.
          Excited to share my progress and learnings here! <br>

          Side note: I'm currently reading "Children of Dune" by Frank Herbert, the chapter starting on page 329 could be the
          greatest chapter of a book I have ever read.

        <p>
          Super rainy day today, woke up and read the news while eating breakfast. Slow start to the day. Need to start building plans for my days and sticking to the plans. Allowed myself a good nights sleep last night because of depression vibes. <br>

          Getting pretty hyped about Hyrox in November. <br>

          Today, I plan on working on the Rolyn messaging feature, having some doubts about the design of the app. Need to take a look at how Care does it. 
          Slightly concerned about how much I have relied on AI to design the app. I'm going to just keep going how I've been going and see how it turns out. 
          Hopefully will learn how to read through documentations and error trace myself over time but for now I just need to start getting my ideas up on the screen. <br>

          <br>
          
          Just fixed the 'Start Conversation' button on the page when you click to view the worker's profiles. Woohoo!

          <br>
          Overall, Day 174 of winning.
