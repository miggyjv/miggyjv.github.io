        <p>
          Just got back from Siargao with the older guys. It was too much. Taking a step away from the drinking game. <br>

          <br>

          Fixed onboarding for workers. Still need to figure out user flow. <br>

        <p>
          First meeting w/ Willy and Josh today. I don't think they fully understand what Rolyn actually is and the people we are serving with the app. 
          Need to try to find them some literature or just explain it to them. They have decent ideas, but obviously need to reign them in. So far,
          tech has been super manageable with just me. I will try to set a meeting for next Monday so we can become fully aligned. We'll see how cooperative
          they are in the future. <br>

          <br>

          In other news, lunch with Raya. More work on website. I'm downplaying the work that I have done on the website it actually looks really good. <br>

        <p>
          Leg day today. Hung out w/ Jed and KB last night for the last time. Ay ay. Instead of working on the app today, I am going to work 
          on a basic website. To see how it transitions and to give people something to look at. <br>

          <br>

          Website looks pretty good for day one. Need to either figure out or get rid of this 'status' field for employer posts. The endpoints for the website
          are the most buggy part, sometimes it just gets stuck in a loading state. Especially when going back to the homepage. <br>

        <h3 class="post-title">Day 7 #weekone</h3>
        <p>
          Another slightly off-schedule day. Woke up on time but then ate a long breakfast, then helped Ma and Wab pack and waited for them to leave. 
          Also ordered my LMNT on Lazada. Went to the gym but then Chip was outside so I played with him for about an hour. Actually went to the gym
          did bench press, farmer carry and a bunch of situps. Went to MGC to eat lunch with Jed. Went back home started working. <br>

          <br>
          
          This is where things get interesting. First of all, finished fixing the search functionality it seems. Now currently working on the filter
          functionality. Actually, that's not the interesting part. The interesting part is Willy and Josh inquiring about teaming up -- they will 
          become the lead software devs. I will work on everything else. Interesting proposition... I'd love to work with Sir William and Shua <br>

          <br>

          Cleaned up RecCards and Job Details screen to look MUCH more polished. Personally in love with the new design of the job details screens.
          Tried fixing up the Chat screen and the messaging screen too but still looks kind of ratchet. Honestly, not sure how much you can really 
          do with a chat and messaging screen, so might just revert to something clean and simple. Also weird transitions need work. <br> 

          <br>

          Lastly, although I know I need Rolyn to look very professional and polished, I still want it to maintain a homey and welcome vibe. I need 
          to figure out how to do that. Currently employing a lot of purple. Need to figure out the LOGO!!! <br> 
          
          <br>

          UI beginning to look good, must now focus on matching/recommendation functionality/algorithm.<br>

        <h3 class="post-title">Day 6 #grindweek</h3>
        <p>
          Going to be a bit of an off-schedule day today. Woke up late (9:42am), that's besides the point. I'm playing Mahjong with Ama and Gakung at
          2pm, that'll probably be 3 hours. Then I have some watch conference at 6:30pm with Pa and then dinner with the fam and SH team at close to 8pm.
          Pretty packed schedule, it doesn't look like I'll gym today. <br>

          <br>

          Here will be my (ideal) schedule for each day this week, obviously subject to change due to lunches/walks/events/etc: <br>
          <ul>
            <li>8:30am - 9:00am: Wake up, eat breakfast, read news, go outside and stretch </li>
            <li>9:15am - 10:45am: Exercise (gym or run or Hyrox-specific workout)</li>
            <li>11:00am - 12:30pm: Work on Rolyn</li>
            <li>12:30pm - 1:00pm: Lunch</li>
            <li>1:00pm - 5:00pm: Work on Rolyn (figure out if I should nap or not somewhere in between)</li>
            <li>5:30pm - 6:30pm: Walk with Fam</li>
            <li>7:00pm - 8:00pm: Dinner with Fam</li>
            <li>8:30pm - 10:00pm: Work on Rolyn</li>
            <li>10:00pm - 11:00pm: Misc</li>
            <li>11:30pm: Sleep</li>
          </ul>

          <br>

          Today, first thing on the agenda is to fix the search and filter features of the app. Currently working but quite limited not exhaustive.
          Just saw some Dependabot alerts on Github, don't know what those are but will look into them some time in the future. <br>
          
          Watched some optimised Cursor workflow video on Youtube, resultingly added some .md and .mdc files to the project. Unsure how effective
          they will be but probably worthwhile. Got some Willy feedback will take a look tomorrow. <br>

          Played Mahjong for 3 and a half hours, didn't win a single game. Might've been one of the sleeper maddest I've felt in a while. <br>

        <h3 class="post-title">Day 5 #sundayfunday</h3>
        <p>
          Woke up went to church. Lunch at Canton Road w/ Ama. Basketball with the goons. Peanut butter sandwich and expired chocolate milk for merienda. 
          Took a nap necessary but unnecessary. Going to try to cut out naps on weekdays. <br> 
          
          <br>

          Added 'full name' fields to account and registration pages. Fixed some error handling in the 'worker' dashboard for when the worker had not yet created their profile. 
          Employer postings are unrefined, when they post there are still fields that aren't filled out. <br>

          <br>

          AI-generated description of Rolyn (Cursor's current understanding of it, just in case): <br> Based on my exploration of your codebase, I can see that you're building Rolyn - a job marketplace app specifically designed for domestic workers and employers in Hong Kong. 
          Here's what I understand about your app:
          Rolyn is a domestic worker job marketplace that connects employers (families/households) with domestic workers for various household positions. The app serves two main user types:

        <h3 class="post-title">Day 4 #recoveryday</h3>
        <p>
          Saturday today, went out last night. Frick sake. Went on a walk with Pa, talked about broader vision for Rolyn / about how it could 
          be used for stuff other than employment e.g. upskilling for workers and finding trainers for them. Family day today so didn't work on Rolyn
          All salient features seem to be working sufficiently well. <br>

          <br>

          Clear next steps include making the website. Cleaning up the UI, although I do think it looks pretty good right now. Need to tighten user flow
          and make sure that it is smooth and makes sense. Must spend time thinking about that.

          Double check registration page and make sure that the full name field is there. Need to update the 'Account' page to include the full name field
          Again must refine search and filter features. I need to spend time thinking about how I can make the app include a non-job search aspect without 
          becoming too cluttered. <br>

          Tomorrow I am going to take a look at Care.com again to see how they do the whole thing, do some research on them. Should also probably double 
          text Rishi, couldn't hurt to get more ideas. <br>

          Must think through what information employers would be fine with having visible to workers. <br>

          Huge one, must think about job recommendation algorithm. Some sort of point system or matching algorithm could think back to 103 or 161.
          Ask Willy/Om for advice. <br>

        <p>
          Friday today, slept in once again. Will get to a real schedule next week. Plan to hit chest day and go for a run with Jed later.
          Just got done setting up my monitor finally!!! Makes things so much easier... <br>

          <br>

          In terms of Rolyn, I just made the chat page look a lot nicer, can actually see who sent what messages now. Omar told me I should 
          try to use Claude Code, will try to look into that when Cursor stops working too well. He also told me to try to start using twitter
          apparently it can only lead to good things. #whynotthen 

          <br>

          Current aims for today, it seems that the users are currently being labelled as 'unknown' users in the messages, with no messages yet.
          Need to figure out some way to ID the users, even if its just a first name or something. When we fetch the participant profiles, it seems
          like it tries to fetch the id, full name and avatar url. Looks like something wrong with the fetching -- must look into that. <br>

          IDing the users seems to be working now, messages are fetched properly too. Security Note: I added a policy that enables each user to view the information
          of the other users. E.g. full name and email -- need to check if this is the right way to do it. <br>

          Fixed the messages page to correctly display the most recent conversations along with previews and identify the other user in the chat. <br>

          Have to double check the search and filter features, I can't remember how well I had those working.

        <p>
          Super rainy day today, woke up and read the news while eating breakfast. Slow start to the day. Need to start building plans for my days and sticking to the plans. Allowed myself a good nights sleep last night because of depression vibes. <br>

          Getting pretty hyped about Hyrox in November. <br>

          Today, I plan on working on the Rolyn messaging feature, having some doubts about the design of the app. Need to take a look at how Care does it. 
          Slightly concerned about how much I have relied on AI to design the app. I'm going to just keep going how I've been going and see how it turns out. 
          Hopefully will learn how to read through documentations and error trace myself over time but for now I just need to start getting my ideas up on the screen. <br>

          <br>
          
          Just fixed the 'Start Conversation' button on the page when you click to view the worker's profiles. Woohoo! <br>
          Messaging FUNCTIONALITY now works, UI is still very ugly. The messages tab now works too but each 'conversation' is labelled as an unknown user.
          and it says that it has 'no messages yet' but when you click on the conversation it shows that there are messages. The actual texting screen is very bare bones.
          You can't tell who sent each message but the messages are there at least. <br>

        <p>
          Today I set up this blog to document my journey building Rolyn.
          Excited to share my progress and learnings here! <br>

          Side note: I'm currently reading "Children of Dune" by Frank Herbert, the chapter starting on page 329 could be the
          greatest chapter of a book I have ever read.
