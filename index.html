          <strong>Rolyn</strong> over the next few months. I'll post updates,

        <h3 class="post-title">Day 6 #grindweek</h3>
        <p>
          Going to be a bit of an off-schedule day today. Woke up late (9:42am), that's besides the point. I'm playing Mahjong with Ama and Gakung at
          2pm, that'll probably be 3 hours. Then I have some watch conference at 6:30pm with Pa and then dinner with the fam and SH team at close to 8pm.
          Pretty packed schedule, it doesn't look like I'll gym today. <br>

          <br>

          Here will be my (ideal) schedule for each day this week, obviously subject to change due to lunches/walks/events/etc: <br>
          <ul>
            <li>8:30am - 9:00am: Wake up, eat breakfast, read news, go outside and stretch </li>
            <li>9:15am - 10:45am: Exercise (gym or run or Hyrox-specific workout)</li>
            <li>11:00am - 12:30pm: Work on Rolyn</li>
            <li>12:30pm - 1:00pm: Lunch</li>
            <li>1:00pm - 5:00pm: Work on Rolyn (figure out if I should nap or not somewhere in between)</li>
            <li>5:30pm - 6:30pm: Walk with Fam</li>
            <li>7:00pm - 8:00pm: Dinner with Fam</li>
            <li>8:30pm - 10:00pm: Work on Rolyn</li>
            <li>10:00pm - 11:00pm: Misc</li>
            <li>11:30pm: Sleep</li>
          </ul>

          <br>

          Today, first thing on the agenda is to fix the search and filter features of the app. Currently working but quite limited not exhaustive.

        <h3 class="post-title">Day 5 #sundayfunday</h3>
        <p>
          Woke up went to church. Lunch at Canton Road w/ Ama. Basketball with the goons. Peanut butter sandwich and expired chocolate milk for merienda. 
          Took a nap necessary but unnecessary. Going to try to cut out naps on weekdays. <br> 
          
          <br>

          Added 'full name' fields to account and registration pages. Fixed some error handling in the 'worker' dashboard for when the worker had not yet created their profile. 
          Employer postings are unrefined, when they post there are still fields that aren't filled out. <br>

          <br>

          AI-generated description of Rolyn (Cursor's current understanding of it, just in case): <br> Based on my exploration of your codebase, I can see that you're building Rolyn - a job marketplace app specifically designed for domestic workers and employers in Hong Kong. 
          Here's what I understand about your app:
          Rolyn is a domestic worker job marketplace that connects employers (families/households) with domestic workers for various household positions. The app serves two main user types:

        <h3 class="post-title">Day 4 #recoveryday</h3>
        <p>
          Saturday today, went out last night. Frick sake. Went on a walk with Pa, talked about broader vision for Rolyn / about how it could 
          be used for stuff other than employment e.g. upskilling for workers and finding trainers for them. Family day today so didn't work on Rolyn
          All salient features seem to be working sufficiently well. <br>

          <br>

          Clear next steps include making the website. Cleaning up the UI, although I do think it looks pretty good right now. Need to tighten user flow
          and make sure that it is smooth and makes sense. Must spend time thinking about that.

          Double check registration page and make sure that the full name field is there. Need to update the 'Account' page to include the full name field
          Again must refine search and filter features. I need to spend time thinking about how I can make the app include a non-job search aspect without 
          becoming too cluttered. <br>

          Tomorrow I am going to take a look at Care.com again to see how they do the whole thing, do some research on them. Should also probably double 
          text Rishi, couldn't hurt to get more ideas. <br>

          Must think through what information employers would be fine with having visible to workers. <br>

          Huge one, must think about job recommendation algorithm. Some sort of point system or matching algorithm could think back to 103 or 161.
          Ask Willy/Om for advice. <br>

        <h3 class="post-title">Day 3 #middleground</h3>
        <p>
          Friday today, slept in once again. Will get to a real schedule next week. Plan to hit chest day and go for a run with Jed later.
          Just got done setting up my monitor finally!!! Makes things so much easier... <br>

          <br>

          In terms of Rolyn, I just made the chat page look a lot nicer, can actually see who sent what messages now. Omar told me I should 
          try to use Claude Code, will try to look into that when Cursor stops working too well. He also told me to try to start using twitter
          apparently it can only lead to good things. #whynotthen 

          <br>

          Current aims for today, it seems that the users are currently being labelled as 'unknown' users in the messages, with no messages yet.
          Need to figure out some way to ID the users, even if its just a first name or something. When we fetch the participant profiles, it seems
          like it tries to fetch the id, full name and avatar url. Looks like something wrong with the fetching -- must look into that. <br>

          IDing the users seems to be working now, messages are fetched properly too. Security Note: I added a policy that enables each user to view the information
          of the other users. E.g. full name and email -- need to check if this is the right way to do it. <br>

          Fixed the messages page to correctly display the most recent conversations along with previews and identify the other user in the chat. <br>

          Have to double check the search and filter features, I can't remember how well I had those working.

        <h3 class="post-title">Day 2 #heartbeenbrokesomanytimesdontknowwhattobelieve</h3>
        <p>
          Super rainy day today, woke up and read the news while eating breakfast. Slow start to the day. Need to start building plans for my days and sticking to the plans. Allowed myself a good nights sleep last night because of depression vibes. <br>

          Getting pretty hyped about Hyrox in November. <br>

          Today, I plan on working on the Rolyn messaging feature, having some doubts about the design of the app. Need to take a look at how Care does it. 
          Slightly concerned about how much I have relied on AI to design the app. I'm going to just keep going how I've been going and see how it turns out. 
          Hopefully will learn how to read through documentations and error trace myself over time but for now I just need to start getting my ideas up on the screen. <br>

          <br>
          
          Just fixed the 'Start Conversation' button on the page when you click to view the worker's profiles. Woohoo! <br>
          Messaging FUNCTIONALITY now works, UI is still very ugly. The messages tab now works too but each 'conversation' is labelled as an unknown user.
          and it says that it has 'no messages yet' but when you click on the conversation it shows that there are messages. The actual texting screen is very bare bones.
          You can't tell who sent each message but the messages are there at least. <br>

        <h3 class="post-title">Started the Rolyn Blog!</h3>
        <p>
          Today I set up this blog to document my journey building Rolyn.
          Excited to share my progress and learnings here! <br>

          Side note: I'm currently reading "Children of Dune" by Frank Herbert, the chapter starting on page 329 could be the
          greatest chapter of a book I have ever read.
